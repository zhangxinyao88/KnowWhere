# Knowhere
Knowhere â€“ Navigation application with Google API integration

Inspiration:
I always park my car in a huge parking lot where there're hundreds of hundreds of cars near me and I get confused where I park my car.

What it does:
It's an android app that can mark the location and when we get back, it is able to show us which direction we need to go and the distance between the marked spot.

How we built it:
We utilized Fused Location Provider API, location, GPS and network service under Android Studio.
